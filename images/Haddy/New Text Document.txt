This was the final project for the technological technician where I studied, we were asked to develop a system to be able to pay services, such as: electricity, water, Netflix, Spotify (all simulated of course).

Therefore, after each payment, you generate points to exchange them for IT products (monitors, laptops, cell phones, etc.) that supposedly arrived at your house.

It was a very interesting project to carry out since, unlike Booky or Track It, it was developed with the same equipment as Muss.
